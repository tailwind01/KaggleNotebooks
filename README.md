# Notebooks from Kaggle

This repo contains the Kaggle notebooks and code runs in Jupyter Notebooks run on Kaggle platforms. The exercises committed to this repo are the ones that are given as assignments on Kaggle for machine-learning and SQL certifications.

Like the Practice repo, these solutions/ codeblocks also need to be read in conjunction with the problem statements available on their respective platforms (in this case, Kaggle)
